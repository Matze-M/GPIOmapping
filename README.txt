#       Hey, it's a trivial script, use it any old how, just keep the creds.
#       Next time you see me, buy me a beer. (Has to be Gluten Free though.)
#
# What does it do?
#       It finds all GPIOs on your SBC and prints them all out showing you
#       the mapping that have been defined. Saves having to calculate it all
#       by hand. Useful when porting RPi.GPIO python and shell scripts or
#       C code over to a new SBC.
